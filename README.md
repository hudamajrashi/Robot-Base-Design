# Robot Base Design

This repository contains the mechanical design of a **two-wheel differential robot base**, modeled in **Onshape** and optimized for **3D printing** with a focus on **weight reduction** and **structural stability**.

---

## Design Features

- **Compact dimensions:**  
  120 × 100 mm base footprint  
- **Lightweight design:**  
  Internal shelling applied to reduce material usage
- **Stable motor mounting:**  
  Motors are aligned to ensure smooth wheel rotation
- **Electronics-ready layout:**  
  Dedicated mounting points for controller and motor driver

---

## Weight Optimization & 3D Printing

The base was prepared for 3D printing using the following considerations:

- **Material:** PLA  
  - Lightweight  
  - Easy to print  
  - Suitable for prototyping
- **Shell (hollowing):** 1.5 mm  
- **Layer height:** 0.1 mm  
- **Wall loops:** 3  
- **Final estimated weight:** **12.78 g** (measured using EufyMake Studio)
